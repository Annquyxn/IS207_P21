- **MapPopup**: Handles popup displays when clicking on map markers
- **MapLegend**: Displays the map legend with explanations of different marker types
- **LocationControls**: User interface for location detection and status messages
- **MarkerLayer**: Manages markers/points on the map
- **RouteLayer**: (Placeholder) For displaying routes between locations
- **LocationUtils**: Utility functions for location-related operations

## Usage

### Basic Map Display

```jsx
import MapComponent from '../components/features/map/MapComponent';

// Simple map with GearVN headquarters
<MapComponent height="400px" />

// Map with delivery location
<MapComponent 
  height="500px" 
  deliveryAddress="123 Đường Nguyễn Huệ, Quận 1, TP. HCM" 
/>

// Map with structured address data
<MapComponent 
  addressData={{
